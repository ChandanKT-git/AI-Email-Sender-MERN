# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a complete Express.js backend server that provides AI-powered email generation and sending capabilities. The system will integrate with Groq's AI API for email content generation and use Nodemailer with Gmail SMTP for email delivery. The backend will expose RESTful endpoints for generating email content from prompts and sending emails to multiple recipients.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up a complete Express.js server with proper middleware configuration, so that I can build a robust email sender application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL load environment variables using dotenv
2. WHEN the server initializes THEN the system SHALL configure Express with JSON and CORS middleware
3. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL listen on port 5000 and log "Server running on http://localhost:5000"
4. WHEN requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle CORS properly for cross-origin requests

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate email content using AI, so that I can create professional emails from simple prompts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to /generate THEN the system SHALL accept a JSON body with { prompt: string }
2. WHEN the prompt is received THEN the system SHALL send it to Groq's chat API at https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions
3. WHEN calling Groq API THEN the system SHALL use the mixtral-8x7b-32768 model
4. WHEN authenticating with Groq THEN the system SHALL use process.env.GROQ_API_KEY for the API key
5. WHEN the AI response is received THEN the system SHALL return the generated email content as { email: string }
6. WHEN an error occurs during generation THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error response

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send emails to multiple recipients, so that I can distribute generated or custom email content efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to /send THEN the system SHALL accept a JSON body with { recipients: string (comma-separated), subject: string, body: string }
2. WHEN sending emails THEN the system SHALL use Nodemailer with Gmail SMTP configuration
3. WHEN authenticating with Gmail THEN the system SHALL use process.env.EMAIL_ID and process.env.EMAIL_PASS credentials
4. WHEN recipients are provided as comma-separated string THEN the system SHALL parse and send to multiple recipients
5. WHEN email is sent successfully THEN the system SHALL respond with { success: true }
6. WHEN an error occurs during sending THEN the system SHALL respond with { error: string }

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modular route structure, so that the codebase is maintainable and well-organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing the code THEN the system SHALL have separate route files for generate and send functionality
2. WHEN structuring the project THEN the system SHALL have routes/generate.js for AI email generation
3. WHEN structuring the project THEN the system SHALL have routes/send.js for email sending functionality
4. WHEN the main server file is created THEN the system SHALL import and use the modular routes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper environment variable configuration, so that sensitive credentials are managed securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL provide a sample .env file with required variables
2. WHEN configuring environment variables THEN the system SHALL include GROQ_API_KEY for AI API access
3. WHEN configuring environment variables THEN the system SHALL include EMAIL_ID and EMAIL_PASS for Gmail SMTP
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load all environment variables properly
